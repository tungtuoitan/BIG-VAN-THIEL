# NOTE
Hi, firstly I want to thank you a lot, as you are the reason for this project that made me burn out in the last three days, and I really enjoy it.

Although I tried my best, there are bugs, mistakes, and unfinished features that I didn't have a chance to complete. Feel free to give me feedback, as your feedback is of great value to me.

I started with the frontend, and during the process, I realized that I can't focus on both frontend and backend equally. So, I prioritized the frontend and ended up with fewer lines of code in the backend.

Now, it's already 2:30 PM, and I need to get some sleep. In conclusion, I would greatly appreciate your feedback. Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!
